* You are allowed to use as many password crackers and word lists that you want and that you can find.
* You are allowed to use any infrastructure to crack the passwords (e.g., Amazon Web Services, as many graphic cards that you can afford).  Please note that you are responsible for all costs.
* This assignment is due as specified in D2L.
