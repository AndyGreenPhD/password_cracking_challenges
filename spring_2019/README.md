# Password Cracking - Spring 2019

## Instructions

Download [crackme.txt](crackme.txt).  Crack as many of the passwords that you can and answer the following:

1. Submit your assignment as a text file in D2L.

2. Describe your methodology in detail.  I want details here - what computing resources did you use?  What software did you use?  Why did you make these choices?  Describe your efforts!  Explain to me how you did what you did, and why you did it that way.

3. Submit your cracked password list using `username:password` format for each password that you crack.

4. For each entry, identify the hashing algorithm used.

## Rules

* This is an extra credit assignment.
* Please be sure to keep records of your cracked passwords, including password pot, screenshots, and logs in case you are questioned.
* You are allowed to use as many password crackers and word lists that you want and that you can find.
* You are allowed to use any infrastructure to crack the passwords (e.g., Amazon Web Services, as many graphic cards that you can afford).  Please note that you are responsible for all costs.
* This assignment is due as specified in D2L.
* You will have unlimited submissions for this lab.  Submit often.  However, you MUST submit each file with a .txt extension so that I can read it natively inside D2L.  If I cannot click on the filename and read it, you will not receive credit.
